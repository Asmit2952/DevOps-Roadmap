# DevOps-Roadmap

This repository contains my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of DevOps.

The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources. I will be listing down my take on different tools and learnings from them. 

This repository is inspired by the [roadmap](https://github.com/saiyam1814/DevOpsRoadmap2022/blob/main/DevOps%20roadmap%202022.pdf) drafted by [Saiyam Pathak](https://github.com/saiyam1814).
