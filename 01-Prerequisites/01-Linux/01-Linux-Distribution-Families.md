# Linux Distribution Families

![linux-distributions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81866614/173221722-4b226a9e-ca55-4039-b53a-2676f64cbcb8.png)

There are hundreds of various Linux distributions, depending on various needs and configurations. Refer to the list [here](https://lwn.net/Distributions/). People see a need, and develop special configurations and utilities to respond to that need. Sometimes that effort creates a whole new distribution of Linux. Sometimes, that effort will leverage an existing distribution to expand the members of an existing family.

There are three major distribution families:

* Debian Family Systems (such as Ubuntu) - The Debian family is upstream for Ubuntu, and it has been widely used for cloud deployments.
* RHEL Family Systems (such as Fedora) - RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux ) is widely used by enterprises which host their own systems.
* SUSE Family Systems (such as openSUSE) - SLES (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server) is widely used in retail and many other sectors.

Refer this [document](./installing-linux.pdf) by The [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), on how to prepare your machine for Linux installation, that helps you to select a Linux distribution to install, decide on whether you want to do a stand-alone pure Linux machine or a dual-boot one, whether to do a physical or virtual install, etc. 

I will be using [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) on dual boot for my learnings.
